# Health Monitoring System

A health monitoring system is designed, consisting of a temperature sensor and an optic heart-rate monitor, interacting with a microcontroller. Since physical sensor measurements are ill-suited for digital interfacing, the main focus of this report is the conditioning, filtering and amplification of the aforementioned. Circuits are simulated in LTSpice, and Python code processes the obtained data on a microprocessor. See Reports/Assignment 3/von_Eschwege_21785155_A3.pdf for a detailed explanation.

I, Daniel von Eschwege, 21785155, declare that the entirety of the work contained here is my own work towards completing E344 at
Stellenbosch University, and that I am the sole author thereof. I understand that copying someone elseâ€™s
work is theft, and that doing so may lead to disciplinary action against me.
