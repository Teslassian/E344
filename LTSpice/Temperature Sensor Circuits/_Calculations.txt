0 deg/C => 0.44V
delta V => 0.035V

34 deg/C => 0.44 + 0.035(34) = 1.63V
38 deg/C => 0.44 + 0.035(38) = 1.77V
42 deg/C => 0.44 + 0.035(42) = 1.91V

delta 8 deg/C => 0.035(8) = 0.28V
this needs to be amplified to a 3.8V swing
Thus, gain of approx. 14V/V

0 deg/C => 0.44V
this offset needs to be removed
