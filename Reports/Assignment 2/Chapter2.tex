\section{Introduction} \label{sec:heartIntro}
%**********************************************
Circuits pertaining to signal conditioning, pulse signal and analogue output generation will be discussed. Conditioning is done via filtering and amplification; active filters provide high input and low output impedance, and a large Q-factor \cite{actpas}. A differential amplifier is suitable for amplification, as the gain is referenced against a customizable voltage \cite{opamp}. A Schmitt Trigger is well-suited for pulse generation, as it provides a noise margin \cite{schmitt}. PWM signals can be converted to analogue using filtering \cite{PWM}. \textbf{check template at end to make sure everything is included}

The complete circuit is shown upfront in figure \ref{fig:circuit} in order to aid with explanation. Note that when resistor values are selected at random, the largest resistor in the sub-circuit is always chosen to be \SI{500}{k\Omega}, as to reduce current usage. The design process now follows.\\
The stimulus input signal contains noise at \SI{0.25}{Hz} and at \SI{5}{Hz} and higher. The information in the signal resides between \numrange{0.8}{2.5} \si{Hz}, corresponding to 50 and 150 BPM respectively. Noise results in distorted square wave output, necessitating filtering. A first order passive high-pass filter, cutoff frequency \SI{0.606}{Hz}, attenuates the low frequency noise. With R18 = \SI{500}{k\Omega}, C8 = \SI{525}{nF} according to $f_{c} = \frac{1}{2\pi R C}$. The capacitor is connected to a virtual ground of \SI{2.5}{V}, thus centering the signal around \SI{2.5}{V}. A second order active low-pass filter, cutoff frequency \SI{4.1}{Hz}, filters out high frequency noise. R5 = R6 = \SI{500}{k\Omega}, C1 = C2 = \SI{77}{nF} - see aforementioned formula. Cutoff frequencies were selected to remove noise maximally while minimally affecting heart-rate data. The signal should reside slightly above \SI{2.5}{V} to facilitate amplification (to be discussed). Thus, Rb1 = \SI{500}{k\Omega} and Ra1 = \SI{10}{k\Omega} since $A_v=1+\frac{R_{A}}{R_{B}}$ 
\cite{filter}. The TL081 op-amp is used, as it is less expensive than the TLC2272 \cite{octo}. A filter output with DC offset slightly above \SI{2.5}{V} allows for the use of a differential amplifier with the existing virtual ground connected to the negative input, thus removing the need for additional circuitry otherwise required to provide a voltage level at the negative input. The signal is amplified according to $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{OUT}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{a}}{\mathrm{R}_{b}}\left(\mathrm{V}_{2}-\mathrm{V}_{1}\right)$ \cite{opamp}, where R\textsubscript{a} corresponds to R7 and R9, and R\textsubscript{b} to R8 and R10. The gain of 50 was selected to again provide a DC offset of \SI{2.5}{V}, as it facilitates implementation of the comparator (to be discussed). Since the amplified signal has an amplitude of only \SI{1.66}{V}, the inexpensive TL081 was chosen despite having a smaller output range. Next, the signal is fed into a Schmitt Trigger comparator, which produces \SI{5}{V} if the input exceeds the upper trip point (UTP) and \SI{0}{V} if the input falls below the lower trip point (LTP) \cite{schmitt}. The range between the UTP and LTP is referred to as the hysteresis width and serves as a noise margin \cite{schmitt} around the reference voltage, $V_{REF}$. The hysteresis width was chosen as \SI{0.5}{V} as to be an order of magnitude larger than the highest levels of noise present on the signal serving as input to the comparator. As mentioned previously, the amplified signal has a DC offset of \SI{2.5}{V}, which was chosen as to require V\textsubscript{REF} = \SI{2.5}{V}, once again allowing for the use of the existing virtual ground (instead of additional circuitry) at the negative input of the LT1018 comparator, which was chosen as it allows for output very close to 0 and 5V, and has a high gain. Now, UTP = \SI{2.75}{V}, LTP = \SI{2.25}{V}, UTP = $V_{REF} + \beta Vcc$ and LTP = $V_{REF} - \beta Vcc$, thus $\beta$ = 0.05 \cite{schmitt}. Further, $\beta=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{22}}{\mathrm{R}_{22}+\mathrm{R}_{21}}$. Thus R21 = \SI{190}{k\Omega} and R22 = \SI{10}{k\Omega}. (R21 was later adjusted to \SI{100}{k\Omega} to account for loading effects). The design specifications require a pulse width of at least \SI{150}{ms}. A one-shot was considered to extend the pulses, but was omitted as the requirement could be met without it. All of the aforementioned thus produces a square wave output, where the frequency of the pulses directly relates to the heart-rate.\\

Obtaining an output suitable for a microcontroller presents itself as a problem of converting frequency to analogue. The decision was made to obtain a PWM signal from the FM pulse signal, as PWM signals lend themselves more readily to conversion-to-analogue using a simple low-pass RC filter. Pulse-width modulation was achieved by means of a D flip-flop. The essence of the design is to firstly keep the output high continually, but to then drive the output low for a fixed time, once per period. Since the period of the clock signal varies against BPM, driving low for a fixed amount of time results in a different ratio of the pulse being low at different frequencies, producing a varying duty cycle. Specifically, the previously generated pulse signal is used as a clock signal for the D flip-flop, and the not-Q output is fed back into the data line. This would normally drive the output high for all time $t$; thus a RC circuit is added of which the capacitor is charged by the not-Q output, and connected to the SET-line of the flip-flop. Once the capacitor charges to \SI{2.5}{V}, Q is pulled high and not-Q low until the next rising edge of the clock input inverts Q and not-Q. The result is a slightly delayed PWM signal, with a large duty cycle at high frequencies, and vice-versa. This configuration was preferred above the standard one-shot setup, as it results in a linear and consistent PWM output, as long as the capacitor charge time is selected to be shorter than the narrowest pulse of the clock signal. See section \ref{sec:heartResults}, figure \ref{fig:pwm} for output graphs. The calculations follow.

Select R1 = \SI{500}{k\Omega}. The capacitor charge oscillates between $V_L$ and $V_H$. $V_H =$ \SI{2.5}{V}. $V_L$ is reached for the first time at $t_{L_1}$ and $V_H$ at $t_{H_1}$. $V_L$ is then reached at  $t_{L_2}$. For \SI{150}{BPM} (or \SI{2.5}{Hz}), the pulse drives high for \SI{0.2}{ms}. Since the capacitor has to charge faster than \SI{0.2}{ms}, a charge time of \SI{0.16}{ms} was selected to add a 20\% margin, accounting for noise. Thus $t_{H_1} - t_{L_1} = 0.16$ and $t_{L_2} = 0.4 - 0.16 = 0.24$ for the 150 BPM signal. Finally,

$$V_L = 5\left(1-e^{\frac{t_{L_1}}{\tau}}\right)$$
$$V_H = 5\left(1-e^{\frac{-t_{H_1}}{\tau}}\right)$$
$$V_L = V_H\left(e^{\frac{t_{L_1}}{\tau}}\right)$$

giving $C = 1\mu$. Solving of equations is omitted here for the sake of brevity. See Appendix C for the relevant Matlab script.


Having obtained a PWM signal, a fourth order passive low-pass filter produces analogue values in the range of \numrange{0.95}{1.2} \si{V}. A cutoff frequency of \SI{0.5}{Hz} ensures maximal attenuation of noise while maintaining a 5\% settling time of 10 seconds. Therefore resistor values are \SI{500}{k\Omega} and capacitor values are \SI{1}{\mu}. Finally, the analogue output is amplified by means of a differential amplifier with a negative input at \SI{0.938}{V}. A gain of 20 produces a sufficient output range. Resistor values were chosen to be large as to minimize loading effects. Thus, R2 = R12 = \SI{900}{k\Omega} and R11 = R13 = \SI{45}{k\Omega} according to $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{OUT}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{a}}{\mathrm{R}_{b}}\left(\mathrm{V}_{2}-\mathrm{V}_{1}\right)$ \cite{opamp}. Loading effects still had a slight effect, and required adapting R11 and R13 to \SI{41}{k\Omega}. An analogue transducer is thus designed, and can be connected to a microcontroller.

The frequency response of both the high- and low-pass filters are $-3dB$ at \SI{0.606}{Hz} and $-6dB$ at \SI{4.3}{Hz} respectively, as shown in figures \ref{subfig:hpf} and \ref{subfig:lpf1}, thus matching the design calculations almost perfectly. \textbf{current!!!!!!!}

The filtered signal is passed through a differential amplifier; the input is shown in blue and the output in red in figure \ref{fig:amplified}. The filtered signal has a \SI{50}{mV} amplitude (peak-to-peak), and the output \SI{1.747}{V}. Therefore $A_v \approx 35$, which, although smaller than calculated, is to be expected due to non-linear behaviour for high amplification factors.

\end{figure}

Following amplification, the signal is passed into a LT1018 comparator. Input and output thereof is shown in figure \ref{fig:pulses}. Measurements yielded UTP = \SI{2.75}{V} and LTP = {2.25}{V}, giving a hysteresis width of \SI{0.5}{V}, exactly as calculated. The cursor at the top right in figure \ref{fig:pulses} measures the narrowest pulse at 150 BPM as to demonstrate compliance with the \SI{150}{ms} requirement, and the lower right gives the values of the tip points.

For the analogue transducer, a PWM signal is obtained as in figure \ref{fig:pwm}. Section \ref{sec:heartDesign} explains tne interrelation of the signals, where \texttt{voutbeatpulses, pwm, /q} and \texttt{rc} correspond to the clock signal, Q, not-Q and the charging capacitor voltage respectively. As shown, the pulse is high for about \SI{730}{ms} of every \SI{1}{s} period in the case of 60 beats per minute. A duty cycle of 73\% is thus obtained, and decreases to 56\% for \SI{0.223}{s} of \SI{0.4}{s} at 150 beats per minute - see figure \ref{fig:curses}.
