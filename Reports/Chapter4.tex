\section{System}
Concluding, it has been shown that the combination of the voltage regulator and the temperature sensing circuitry works very well to achieve the desired result. Since the design is modular, it should be easy to integrate with the rest of the health monitoring system, by feeding the output of the temperature sensor into the system designed in this report, and then connecting the output of this system to the microcontroller ADC. This requires relatively few connections. Since the cascaded filters ensure extremely low noise levels, the ADC should be capable of distinguishing the measured temperature to a very high degree of accuracy. However, the ADC still has to be calibrated to fit the amplified signal's range, which is now from A to B. Since the noise is low, the measurement error should be less than \%, as the quantisation error is \%.
(E.g. what the calibration will look like and what the the measurement error will be given the range, quantisation error and noise).
