\chapter{System and conclusion}

\section{System}
The complete design goes to show that a health-monitoring system, consisting of temperature and heart-rate sensing circuitry, powered by a voltage regulator and interfacing with a microcontroller, successfully performs its function while adhering to all base and bonus specifications. The modular design of different parts of the health-monitoring system simplifies both design and debugging.    \\

The temperature sensor produces the desired output with full range. The filters ensure extremely low noise levels, allowing the ADC to distinguish the temperature to a very high degree of accuracy. The system uses more of the less costly components and is very power efficient.\\

The heart-rate sensor effectively converted a noisy input signal to a square wave output and an analogue output. Due to the second order low-pass filter, the heart-rate sensor is remarkably robust with respect to variations in noise, attenuating noise levels to below 6\% of the signal amplitude before creating a pulse output. The design also performs well on a variety of the normalised input data sets. Noise is filtered to the extent that it has a negligible effect on the digitalized reading. The system utilizes less costly components where possible and is very power efficient. Interfacing of real-world measurements with digital systems is achieved by connecting the heart-rate circuit to a microcontroller, producing a digital heart-rate reading.

\section{Lessons learnt}
1. LTSpice is a blessing, but can be an absolute nightmare with simulations. I've created a rough metric; it goes to show that 30\% of my time was spent on circuit design, 10\% on report writing, and 60\% on debugging LTSpice simulation problems.

2. I believe to have greatly improved with regards to modularising and debugging not only circuits, but systems in general. Treating everything as a small problem to be solved furthered my conceptual understanding of component interaction.

3. I shouldn't have gone surfing for the entirety of the first week of both terms. I lost a bunch of marks for saying this in Assignment 1, but the adage still holds true, so I'll say it again.
